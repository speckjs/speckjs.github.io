## About
SpeckJS is an npm module that parses JavaScript and outputs unit-tests. SpeckJS currently supports [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), and [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)/[Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).

SpeckJS comes with plugins for [Grunt](https://github.com/speckjs/grunt-speckjs), [Gulp](https://github.com/speckjs/gulp-speckjs) and [Atom](https://github.com/speckjs/atom-speckjs).

Our goal with SpeckJS is to make it as easy as possible to get started using Test-Driven Development on a new project, to quickly add unit-tests to your existing project, or anywhere in between. We know the value of well-tested code, and SpeckJS is here to make that simpler than ever.
